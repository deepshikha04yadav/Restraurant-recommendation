# Restaurant Recommendation System

A Jupyter Notebook–based project that builds a restaurant recommendation system leveraging machine learning techniques. It includes data exploration, model training, and submission-ready outputs.

##  Project Overview

This repository contains a notebook solution for recommending restaurants to users based on relevant features such as ratings, cuisine, and location. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and generating output ready for submission or deployment.

### Key Folders & Files

- `notebook/` – Primary Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing steps, model building, and evaluation.
- `submission/` – Contains final results or files ready for submission or further integration.
- `.gitattributes` – Git attributes for consistent behavior across platforms.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python ≥ 3.7  
- Key libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```
   git clone https://github.com/deepshikha04yadav/Restraurant-recommendation.git
   cd Restraurant-recommendation
```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Tip: If a requirements.txt file isn’t present, install them manually as needed.

### Usage

1. Open the notebook:
```
jupyter notebook notebook/RestraurantRecommendation.ipynb
```

2. Follow the notebook’s structured flow:

* Data Loading & Exploration: Understand your dataset through summary statistics and visualizations.

* Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data via handling missing values, encoding, and scaling.

* Modeling: Train and evaluate recommendation models (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based).

* Prediction & Submission: Generate your predictions and export them to the submission/ folder.

### Features & Workflow Summary
```
|Stage                 | Details
|______________________|_______________________________________________________________
|Preprocessing	       | Missing-value handling, normalization, encoding
|Feature Engineering   | Incorporating cuisine types, ratings, location, etc.
|Model Development     | Training recommendation logic and validation
|Evaluation	           | Using relevant metrics (RMSE, precision at K, recall, etc.)
|Output Submission	   | Saving final recommended outputs in proper format for deployment
```
